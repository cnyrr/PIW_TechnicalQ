# User Control Panel Design

## Components

### User Table
<p>A table listing ID, Username, Email and Account Status on left half of the screen.<p/>

- <p>Table elements should have alternating white and blue backgrounds to improve readability.<p/>

- <p>Table should default to ascending ID order without filters when first started and remember user choices.<p/>

- <p>Table should be rearrangable and filterable by clicking respective sort and filter buttons.<p/>

### Settings

<p>This screen displays selected users Username as a header on top and Username, Display Name, Phone, Email, User Roles and Account Status fields in order on right half of the screen.<p/>

- <p>Username, Display Name, Phone and Email should have editable fields.<p/>

- <p>User Roles must have a special field opening a menu that lists available roles, active ones in blue color.<p/>

- <p>Account Status should be displayed as a checkbox and written as Enabled.

### Upper Bar

<p>Above other two components there should be a small gray bar for buttons.<p/>


#### Save Button

<p>Users must click blue "Save User" button on right side of the bar to have changes take effect for new or changed user.<p/>

#### New User Button

<p>Users should click "+ New User" button on left side of the screen to create an empty user template with empty fields. User isn't created until save button is clicked.<p/>

<p>Note: This should be the default screen everytime panel is opened.<p/>

#### Hide Button

<p>Next to the save button there should be a checkbox and "Hide Disabled User" text, enabling this should hide disabled users from User Table<p/>
